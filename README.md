This document is an outline of our testing plan for the Mobile POS System and eCommerce portal that performs all of the day-to-day operations. This project aims to provide a public-facing Point of Sale App for in-person and online orders. This document will cover the various requirements that will be applied to the listed application's device, integration, and device testing. The white box, black box, and system-testing paradigms can be used to apply testing criteria. The assessment requirements, processes, and test cases of the overall design would be included in this paradigm, but not limited to them. We'll use the test documentation requirements outlined in IEEE Standard 829 for Software Test Documentation during the testing period.
